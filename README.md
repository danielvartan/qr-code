## Overview

This repository provides a reproducible pipeline for generating QR Codes in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

The pipeline report is available [here](https://danielvartan.github.io/qr-code/).

> If you find this project useful, please consider giving it a star! [![GitHub repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/danielvartan/qr-code)](https://github.com/danielvartan/qr-code/)

## Usage

The pipeline was developed using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system and the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). To ensure consistent results, the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package is used to manage and restore the R environment.

After installing the three dependencies mentioned above, follow these steps to reproduce the analyses:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open** the project in your preferred IDE.
3. **Restore the R environment** by running [`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/restore.html) in the R console. This will install all required software dependencies.
4. **Open** `index.qmd` and run the code as described in the report.
